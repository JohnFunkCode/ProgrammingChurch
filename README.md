# niece-python-lessons
This repo contains a bunch of lesson to help my nieces learn Python

## Tools used:
For these lessons we will rely on core material from the following online material:
* [Udemy Complete Pything Programming Course]( https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-programming-course-beginner-to-advanced/learn/v4/overview) I like this one because it starts people out using Jupyter notebook
* [Packt Beginning Python Video](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/beginning-python-video) This one is more programmer centric

***
## January 1st session
In this session we'll review your installation of Anaconda and PyCharm.  And do some simple things with Jupyter notebook.
#### Prerequisites
Sections 1 - 3 of the Udemy Complete Python Programming Course
***
## January 7th session
In this session we're going to review user input, dictionaries, and introduce for loops.
#### Prerequisites
Sections 4 and 5 of the Udemy Complete Python Programming Course

#### Exercises
* The exercises for the session can be found in this the lessons folder of this repo at: [Jupyter Notebook]( https://github.com/JohnFunkCode/niece-python-lessons/blob/dev/Jan%207%20-%20word%20count%20lesson.ipynb  )
* The stand alone code is available in the src folder of this repo at: [wordcount.py](https://github.com/JohnFunkCode/niece-python-lessons/blob/master/src/wordcount/wordcount.py)

## January 15th session - Loops, Functions and Modules
In this session we're going to begin our discussions about functions and modules
#### Prerequisites
* Sections 6 and 7 of the Udemy Complete Python Programming course
* Section 6 and 7 of the Packt Beginning Python Video course
* Review sections 1-5 of the Packt Beginning Python Video course - most of this will be a review of material from the Udemy course

#### Exercises
* The exercises for the session can be found in this repo at: [Text Analytics Functions.ipynb](https://github.com/JohnFunkCode/niece-python-lessons/blob/master/January%2015%20-%20Loops%20Functions%20Modules%20.ipynb)

## January 20th Session - Using other peoples code 
Kids now days don't understand how lucky they are to have such broad collection of third party code to work with.  You can find a library of code someone else has written to do just about anything you can imagine now days.  In this session we're going to learn how to use add-on packages in Python.  

* Read about using Python packages by reading the two following articles
  * [Python Package Tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/)
  * [Python Package Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html)
* Read about the [Python Standard Libraries](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)  Don't worry about memorizing all of them or learning how to use all of them, for now just get familar with what's available.  Also pick one or two you want to explore.
* Read about [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)  Again don't worry about learning how to use all of Matplot, just get familar with what's available.   We'll start to explore it with some labs.
