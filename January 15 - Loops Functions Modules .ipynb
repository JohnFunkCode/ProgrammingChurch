    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "* Sections 6 and 7 of the Udemy Complete Python Programming course\n",
    "* Section 6 and 7 of the Packt Beginning Python Video course\n",
    "* Review sections 1-5 of the Packt Beginning Python Video course - most of this will be a review of material from the Udemy course\n",

    "### Assignment\n",
    "Today we're going to use your knowledge of loops functions and modules to write a text analytics program with the following capability\n",
    "* Build a word count function that takes a string and returns a dictionary with the word and it's count.  You already wrote this code last week.  We'll just put it in a function in a stand-alone module\n",
    "* Build a function to find the union of words in two strings.  That is all the words that both strings have in common.\n",
    "* Build a function to find all the words that are in one string that aren't in another string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we'll introduce the idea of tests - you'll develop tests for all you code.   And we'll talk about Test Driven Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly you'll build a stand alone program that uses the functions you created to perform text analytics on two blocks of text a user provides."
